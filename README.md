## Getting Started

Welcome to the D0043E course's playground. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Python code in this course

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains four folders by default, where:

- `module_1`: the folder to practice programs from module 1
- `module_2`: the folder to practice programs from module 2
- `module_3`: the folder to practice programs from module 3
- `module_4`: the folder to practice programs from module 4

Each of the folders has two python files in them that you can use to get started.
